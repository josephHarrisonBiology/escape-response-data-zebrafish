Linear Regression Model

This is a Python script for a simple linear regression model that uses the scikit-learn library to predict the turn angle of an object based on its stimulus size, collision speed, and collision angle.

Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.

``git clone https://github.com/your_username/linear-regression-model.git``

Navigate to the project directory.

``cd linear-regression-model``

Install the necessary dependencies using pip.

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Getting Started


Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run the Python script.

``python linear_regression.py``


How it Works

The script uses the scikit-learn library to implement a simple linear regression model. The model is trained on a dataset that contains the stimulus size, collision speed, collision angle, and turn angle of various objects. The goal is to use this model to predict the turn angle of a new object based on its stimulus size, collision speed, and collision angle.

The script first loads the dataset from a CSV file and preprocesses it to handle missing values. It then splits the data into features (stimulus size, collision speed, and collision angle) and target (turn angle) arrays. The model is trained on this data using the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn.

After training, the script calculates the mean squared error (MSE) on the training data to evaluate the performance of the model. Lower values of MSE indicate better performance.

Finally, the script makes a prediction for a new input using the trained model. The user can specify the stimulus size, collision speed, and collision angle of the new input, and the script will output a predicted turn angle.

Overall, this script provides a simple example of how to implement a linear regression model using scikit-learn in Python.
