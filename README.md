The Zebrafish-Larvae-Escape-Data repository contains a comprehensive dataset of escape response behavior observed in zebrafish larvae. The data has been collected through a series of carefully controlled experiments designed to study various aspects of escape responses. This resource aims to provide valuable information for researchers and students who are interested in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying escape responses in zebrafish larvae, as well as those who wish to conduct meta-analyses or comparative studies.

The dataset includes parameters such as:

Stimulus type: This refers to the nature of the stimuli used to elicit escape responses in the zebrafish larvae. Examples include visual, mechanical, or chemical stimuli.
Response latency: This is the time taken for the zebrafish larvae to initiate an escape response after the stimulus has been applied.
Locomotion patterns: This describes the specific movement patterns displayed by the zebrafish larvae during their escape response, such as C-start or S-start, which are well-known escape behaviors in fish.
In addition, the dataset contains information on various other variables, such as age, size, and genetic background of the zebrafish larvae, which can be useful for researchers interested in studying the influence of these factors on escape response behaviors.

The data is provided in a well-structured and easy-to-use format, such as CSV or Excel, which can be easily imported into various data analysis tools and software.

We encourage researchers and students to contribute to the repository by adding new data, analyses, or resources related to zebrafish larvae escape responses. Collaborations and suggestions for improvement are always welcome, as we strive to make this repository an invaluable tool for advancing our understanding of escape responses in zebrafish larvae and beyond.
